A sketchbook for all

[foo *bar*]: IDEah.jpg "a sketch"


There was a time when I was into art. I was never under the illusion that I would make it in that world, but I was still interested so I carried around a sketchbook. It was supposed to be for drawing, but I ended up using it for everything and taking it everywhere. It was as happy in my backpack or on the passenger seat of my truck as it was on my desk in my workspace. I never really gave it up and right now there is still a physical, unruled, bound sketchbook on my desk by my laptop. There is a pen shoved in between the pages.

I'm not the only one. To this day I see workers that sketch out an idea on a piece of steel before before sitting down at a laptop with CAD to create the files necessary to feed to the plasma table.

- Sketches of everything 
    + landscsapes
    + drawings
    + doodles
- Code that I was having a hard time figuring out, or learning
- Scaled drawings that I would take with me to the wporkshop and build directly from the drawing
- Poetry
- Musings of all sorts
- PWDs
- Phone Numbers
- Adresses/directions/maps
- Recipes (whats the differnece between a recipe and an algorythm? not much)

Some how the physical act of writing, drawing or sketching triggered my brain into creative mode and helped me to both create and remember what I created. I used to think I was silly for not being a digital native like I was told I was suppsed to be. I'm just an analog guy, but why not bridge that gap!

## IDEah! Specificatins:
It should NOT have internet connectivity as a requirement. The user should be able to create anything anywhere. That makes it egailitarian. The goal is to scale **PRECISION** from rough draft to finished product
### Hardware
- A book type format that a user could open or close
    + one side has a b/w digital ink display so that the user can flip through the pages and examine an idea from the past while not consuming a tremendous amount of battery. Also, I can keep it open when I'm in the shop and want to refer to it.
    + The other side has an editable surface that I can write on with a stylus
- Robust enough to take anywhere rain/shine/hot/cold
- A stylus that has the feel of pen/pencil on paper
- Enough connectivity to connect directly to tooling like CNC machines, 3D printers or software backends
- Enough processing power and storage to handle the software and keep the resulting work untill I want to work on it again
- The ability to connect to a projector so the user can work in collboration with others - no cables please
- GPS
- Camera
### Software
- The ability to draw freehand with enough precision to capture detail
- An integrated piece of sftware that can turn a hand drawn sketch into a CAD drawing for further editing and sending to the tool
- Simple word procesing and spreadsheet software
- GPS and simple cartograpy/CAD software, so the user can map out and record an archaelolgy site in the field. It should also be able to link an item on the map to a spreadsheet 
- The ability to to optionaly convert hand written words into computer text
- An IDE that can convert handwritten code into fully formatted code that is ready to run
- Enough flexibility to handle add-ons for things like graphics and SVG eiditors, measuring tools or 3D mapping devices
- Version control for the whole process


I am aware that that most if not most if not ALL of the above is already in the public domain or open source, so **the entire hardware/software stack should be open source.** Not much of this is new, so the project is mostly integration and UI/UX work.

This idea is beyond my ability to produce, but I want it made so it's open source. Merry Christmas 12/125/2024
